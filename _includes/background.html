  <div class="section__content">
    <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building beautiful web applications, and working with the data flow in those applications.
      I love the thrill of solving problems and overcoming challenges. I work mostly with laravel and Javascript (react, node, express).

    <p>
      <strong>When I'm not coding</strong>, I'm probably hanging out with my family, reading football news or playing paino.</p>
